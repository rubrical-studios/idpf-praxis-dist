## IDPF-Vibe Framework

**Location:** `E:\Projects\idpf-praxis\IDPF-Vibe\`
**Core Framework Revision:** 4.0
**Type:** Exploratory Development → Structured Evolution

### Purpose
Enable exploratory development phase without formal requirements, then evolve into structured TDD development (Structured or Agile) when project direction crystallizes.

### Architecture

**Core Framework:**
- Vibe-to-Structured-Core-Framework.md (Rev 4.0): Platform-agnostic workflow

**Platform-Specific Frameworks:**
- Vibe-to-Structured-Desktop-Framework.md (Rev 2): Windows, macOS, Linux applications
- Vibe-to-Structured-Mobile-Framework.md (Rev 3): iOS, Android, cross-platform mobile
- Vibe-to-Structured-Web-Framework.md (Rev 2): Frontend, backend, full-stack web
- Vibe-to-Structured-Game-Framework.md (Rev 1): Godot, Unity, Unreal, browser games
- Vibe-to-Structured-Embedded-Framework.md (Rev 1): Arduino, ESP32, STM32, simulator-based
- Vibe-to-Structured-Newbie-Framework.md (Rev 1): Beginner-friendly with Skills integration

### Three-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1: VIBE PHASE**
- Exploratory, rapid iteration development
- Natural language prompts ("Try-This", "Show-Me", "Run-It")
- No formal requirements or testing required
- Focus on discovery and experimentation
- Capture what works, discard what doesn't

**Vibe Commands:**
- Vibe-Start: Begin exploratory development
- Try-This: Experiment with idea
- Show-Me: Display current state
- That-Works: Keep current implementation
- Undo-That: Revert last change
- Run-It: Execute and test
- Vibe-Status: Progress check
- Vibe-End: Pause/save snapshot (resume later)
- Ready-to-Structure: Trigger evolution
- Vibe-Abandon: Stop project entirely

**Phase 2: EVOLUTION POINT**
- Triggered when: User says "Ready-to-Structure" or project feels complete
- ASSISTANT guides evolution to IDPF-Agile

**Evolution to IDPF-Agile:**
- Best when: Feature set identified, need sprints/prioritization, team collaboration
- Generates: As-built Product Backlog with completed stories (DONE)
- Documents: Vibe features as Story 0.x (completed) + Pending stories (backlog)
- Status: "Ready for Sprint 1" or "No pending stories - project complete"

**Phase 3: AGILE PHASE**
- Switch to IDPF-Agile framework
- All new development follows TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Add tests for existing vibe-phase code
- Complete remaining stories with full rigor

### Critical Setup: Two-Tool Workflow

## IDPF-Testing Framework

**Location:** `IDPF-Testing/IDPF-Testing.md`
**Type:** Foundational Testing Framework

### Purpose
Establish common architecture, terminology, workflows, and integration patterns for all testing-focused development efforts. IDPF-Testing is the foundation that specialized testing frameworks extend.

**Core Principle:** "Test automation is software development. It uses the same tools, requires the same skills and same practices."

### Testing Framework Architecture

```
IDPF-Testing (foundation)
    ├── IDPF-QA-Automation      (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Appium)
    ├── IDPF-Performance        (k6, JMeter, Gatling, Locust)
    ├── IDPF-Security           (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, SAST/DAST)
    ├── IDPF-Accessibility      (axe, Lighthouse, Pa11y)
    ├── IDPF-Chaos              (Chaos Monkey, Gremlin, LitmusChaos)
    └── IDPF-Contract-Testing   (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract)
```

### Embedded vs Separate Repository

**Embedded Testing (No IDPF-Testing):**
- TDD (unit tests) - Application repo with IDPF-Agile
- ATDD (acceptance tests) - Application repo with IDPF-Agile
- BDD (behavior specs) - Application repo with IDPF-Agile

**Separate Repository (Uses IDPF-Testing):**
| Testing Type | Framework | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| QA Automation | IDPF-QA-Automation | Independent codebase, different release cycle |
| Performance | IDPF-Performance | Specialized tooling, separate infrastructure |
| Security | IDPF-Security | Scan configs, vulnerability tracking, compliance |
| Chaos | IDPF-Chaos | Experiment definitions, separate from deployment |
| Contract Testing | IDPF-Contract-Testing | Cross-repo coordination between teams |
| Accessibility | IDPF-Accessibility | Flexible: Embedded OR Separate |

### Test Development Methodology

Test repositories use IDPF-Agile for sprint-based test development with backlog management and velocity tracking.

### Workflow Phases

```
PLAN → DESIGN → DEVELOP → EXECUTE → REPORT
```

1. **PLAN:** Create Test Plan, define scope, identify requirements coverage
2. **DESIGN:** Design test architecture, select tools, define patterns
3. **DEVELOP:** Write test code using TDD, build utilities, create test data
4. **EXECUTE:** Run tests (manual trigger, CI/CD, scheduled)
5. **REPORT:** Analyze results, track metrics, report to stakeholders

### Test Plan Document

Test Plans replace PRDs for test repositories. They are lighter weight and reference the application's PRD for traceability.

**Location:** `<test-repo>/PRD/TestPlans/`

**Required Elements:**
- Link to application repository
- Link to application PRD document
- Requirement coverage mapping (REQ-IDs covered)
- Version/release of application under test

### Key Resources

**Templates:**
- Test-Plan-Template.md - Generic test plan structure

**Guides:**
- Testing-Framework-Selection-Guide.md - Decision guide for:
  - Embedded vs Separate repository
  - Which IDPF-Testing framework to use

### Testing Session Commands

**Planning Commands:**
- Test-Plan-Start, Test-Plan-Review, Coverage-Check

**Development Commands:**
- Test-Dev-Start, Run-Tests, Generate-Report

**Standard Commands:**
- All IDPF-Agile commands apply to test development

### Integration Points
- Extends IDPF-Agile (test code follows TDD methodology)
- References Application PRD for traceability
- Uses ATDD/BDD specs from application for test case design
- Outputs test results, coverage reports, metrics

## Assistant Guidelines

**Location:** `E:\Projects\idpf-praxis\Assistant\`
**Purpose:** Ensure accuracy, prevent hallucination, maintain quality standards
**Total Guidelines:** 2 documents

### Anti-Hallucination Rules for Software Development

**Core Principle:** Accuracy over helpfulness. Uncertainty over invention. Verification over assumption.

**Absolute "Never Do" Rules:**
- NEVER invent: API methods, class names, config syntax, command flags, file paths, library dependencies
- NEVER assume: OS/platform, available tools, project structure, versions, environment config
- NEVER describe documentation or UI you cannot see

**Information Source Hierarchy:**
1. User-provided files and context (highest authority)
2. Official documentation (via Web Search)
3. Training data (with version/date context)
4. Logical inference (clearly labeled)

**Confidence Level Indicators:**
- High: "This is the standard approach..."
- Medium: "This is commonly done by..."
- Low: "This might work, but I'm not certain..."
- No confidence: "I don't have reliable information about [X]"

**Auto-trigger Web Search:**
- "current" or "latest" anything
- Recent releases/updates
- Uncertain API syntax
- Installation on specific OS
- Breaking changes between versions

**Decision Trees:**
- When asked about specific syntax: Check certainty → Verify in docs → Search if needed
- When requirements unclear: Ask clarifying questions
- When context missing: Request specific information

**File Operations:**
- Always READ files before editing
- Verify paths exist before referencing
- Enumerate ALL files before bulk operations
- Track progress on multi-file changes

### Anti-Hallucination Rules for Skill Creation

**Core Principle:** Accuracy over helpfulness. Precision over assumption. Verification over invention.

**Key Rules:**
- Never invent content not in source material
- Never assume vague instructions need expansion
- Preserve exact wording and terminology from source
- Only create resource files for content actually in source
- Maintain source document structure without reorganization

**Decision Framework:**
- Map source sections directly to Skill format
- Extract examples/templates only from source
- Verify no additions were made before finalizing
- Use explicit language about source content confidence

---

## Rules Auto-Loading (v2.9+)

**Location:** `.claude/rules/`
**Purpose:** Automatically load essential rules at session start without explicit file reads

### How It Works

Claude Code automatically loads all `.md` files from `.claude/rules/` at session start. This eliminates the need for explicit file reads in startup procedures and ensures rules persist after compaction.

### Rule Files

| File | Content | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| `01-anti-hallucination.md` | Framework development quality rules | `Assistant/Anti-Hallucination-Rules-for-Framework-Development.md` |
| `02-github-workflow.md` | GitHub issue management integration | `Reference/GitHub-Workflow.md` |
| `03-session-startup.md` | Startup procedure and on-demand loading | Generated |

### Benefits

- **No explicit reads:** Rules load automatically at session start
- **Compact-resilient:** Rules persist after context compaction (no re-reading needed)
- **Simplified startup:** CLAUDE.md references rules, doesn't contain procedures
- **Token reduction:** ~47% fewer tokens at startup

### Source of Truth

- **Source files:** `Assistant/` and `Reference/` directories contain authoritative content
- **Rules files:** Built from source at release time (Phase 2e of /prepare-release)
- **User projects:** Hub installer generates rules from templates at installation time

### Naming Convention

Files are numbered for load order: `01-`, `02-`, `03-`, etc. Lower numbers load first.

Legend:  ───► Valid transition
         Agile is terminal (no transitions from Agile)
```

**Invalid Transitions (Never Do):**
```
     ┌───────────┐          ┌───────────┐
     │   AGILE   │──── X ──►│   VIBE    │
     └───────────┘          └───────────┘

     Rationale: Quality standards never decrease.
```

### Valid Transitions

| From Framework | To Framework | When to Transition |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Vibe** | **Agile** | Vibe exploration complete, feature set identified, ready for sprint-based development |

### Transition Principles

**Always Preserved Across Transitions:**
- All existing code and tests
- Git repository and commit history
- TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Testing framework and test suite
- Technical architecture decisions
- Dependencies and configurations

**What Changes:**
- Documentation format (Exploration notes to User Stories)
- Workflow structure (Exploratory to Sprints)
- Planning granularity (Ideas to Stories)
- Progress tracking (Vibes to Velocity)

**Transition Best Practices:**
1. Complete current exploration before transitioning
2. Ensure tests pass (100% green)
3. Commit all work-in-progress
4. Create transition documentation (preserve context)
5. Generate product backlog from vibe exploration
6. Communicate transition to stakeholders (if applicable)

**Invalid Transitions:**

**Never transition:**
- Agile to Vibe (defeats structured discipline)

**Rationale for invalid transitions:**
- Returning to Vibe from Agile abandons testing discipline
- Quality standards should never decrease (always increase or maintain)

  - Vibe: Exploratory, evolves to Agile
  - Testing-Core: Foundation for separate test repositories (QA Automation, Performance, Security, Accessibility, Chaos, Contract Testing)
- **Skills** provide reusable capabilities (TOOLS)
  - PRD: `/create-prd` for requirements engineering (pre-development)
  - TDD phases, beginner setup, support
- **Assistant Guidelines** provide quality control (HOW WELL)
  - Anti-hallucination, accuracy, verification

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. System Instructions MUST be loaded before framework use
2. Single code block format strictly enforced
3. TDD discipline maintained throughout
4. Context preservation across session
5. Anti-hallucination rules applied continuously
6. Framework transitions follow valid paths only

**Framework Selection Matrix:**
