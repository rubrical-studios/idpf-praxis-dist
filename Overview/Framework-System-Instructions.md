# Framework System Instructions Reference
**Version:** v0.22.0
**Source:** Overview/Framework-System-Instructions.md

---

**Location:** `System-Instructions/`
**Critical:** System Instructions are REQUIRED for all framework operation. Frameworks define process; System Instructions define identity and expertise.

## Domain Specialization Architecture
**Pattern:** Core + Domain Specialization
- **Core-Developer-Instructions.md (Rev 1.0)**: Foundation competencies for all developers
- **23 Domain Specialists**: Specialized expertise profiles (loaded with Core)
- **Domain-Selection-Guide.md (Rev 1.0)**: Guide for choosing specialist(s)

**Loading Pattern:**
1. Load Core-Developer-Instructions.md (universal competencies)
2. Load appropriate Domain specialist file(s) for depth
3. Domain extends and deepens core competencies
