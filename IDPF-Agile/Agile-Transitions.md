# Agile-Driven Development Framework - Transitions
**Version:** v0.42.2
**Module:** Transitions (loaded on-demand)

## When to Use Agile Framework
| Use Agile When | Use Structured When | Use Vibe When |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Building product with evolving requirements | Requirements are fixed and well-defined | Starting with unclear requirements |
| Want iterative delivery with regular feedback | Small project with clear scope | Need exploration phase first |
| Need to prioritize features based on value | Single feature or component development | Prototyping before formalizing |
| Working on medium to large projects | Don't need iterative story workflow | |
| Want to track velocity and predictability | | |
| Prefer user-centric feature descriptions | | |
---
## Agile -> Structured
### When to Transition
- Project scope narrows to single well-defined feature
- Team shrinks to solo developer
- Story workflow overhead outweighs benefits
- Requirements become fixed and stable
- Don't need velocity tracking anymore
- Prefer linear feature-by-feature development
### How to Transition
1. Complete any in-progress work and close open issues
2. Ensure all "Done" stories are committed
3. Move incomplete stories back to Product Backlog
4. Convert selected stories into PRD document (use PRD-Structured template)
5. Begin Structured session with "First-Step" command
### What Carries Forward
All existing code and tests | TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles) | Git repository and history | Technical decisions and architecture | Testing framework and practices | Acceptance criteria from stories
### What Changes
User Stories -> PRD document | Story Backlog -> Linear task list | Story workflow -> Direct development | Velocity tracking -> Progress tracking only | Story points -> Feature completion | Remove backlog management overhead
---
## Agile -> LTS
### When to Transition
- Project reaches production and enters maintenance mode
- Active development lifecycle complete
- Only critical bugs and security patches needed
- Backlog is frozen (no new stories accepted)
- Stability and backwards compatibility are paramount
### How to Transition
1. Complete current work or close iteration early
2. Validate all stories are in "Done" status
3. Archive Product Backlog history
4. Run full test suite - must be 100% passing
5. Create comprehensive documentation (README, CHANGELOG, API docs)
6. Tag final active development version
7. Begin using LTS Framework with "LTS-Triage" command
8. Establish EOL (End of Life) date for LTS version
### What Carries Forward
All code, tests, and documentation | Git repository and history | TDD practices for bug fixes | Testing framework
### What Changes
User Stories -> Bug reports | Story Selection -> LTS triage workflow | Active development -> Maintenance mode | New features -> Bug fixes only | Velocity tracking -> Regression prevention | Add conservative fix-only discipline

## Invalid Transitions
**Never:** Agile -> Vibe (defeats purpose of structured development)
---
## Integration with Other Frameworks
### Agile + Vibe Coding
Can combine with Vibe-to-Structured Framework:
1. **Vibe Phase**: Explore and prototype
2. **Create Backlog**: Generate stories from prototype
3. **Agile Phase**: Formalize with stories and TDD
### Agile for Existing Projects
Can apply to existing codebase:
1. **Audit Current State**: Assess what exists
2. **Create Backlog**: Stories for new features + technical debt
3. **Story Selection**: Prioritize improvements
4. **Incremental Enhancement**: Improve through stories
