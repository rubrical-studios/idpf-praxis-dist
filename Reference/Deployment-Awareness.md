# Deployment Awareness (Dev-Only)
**Version:** 1.0
**Source:** Reference/Deployment-Awareness.md

---

**This rule is dev-only.** It describes the `idpf-praxis → idpf-praxis-dist` deployment chain. Users don't receive this rule.

## Deployment Chain
```
Source Files → .min-mirror/ → deploy-dist.yml → -dist repo
                    ↑                              ↓
            /minimize-files              users install from here
```
**Trigger:** Git tag `v*` pushes to `-dist` via GitHub Actions.

## File Classification
| Category | Deployed? | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `.min-mirror/*` | Yes | IDPF-*, Reference/, Skills/, Overview/ |
| `Templates/` | Yes (as-is) | commands/, scripts/, hooks/ |
| Root files | Yes (as-is) | CHANGELOG.md, install.js, LICENSE |
| `Proposal/`, `PRD/`, `Archive/` | No | Dev-only content |
| `.claude/rules/` | No | Generated by install.js for users |
| `.claude/commands/*.md` (maintainer) | No | /prepare-release, /minimize-files |

## When Working Issues
**Before implementing, ask:**
1. Does this change affect user-facing files? → Run `/minimize-files`
2. Is this dev-only (Proposal, PRD, Archive)? → No minimization needed
3. Does this add new directories? → Update `deploy-dist.yml`

## Pre-Commit for User-Facing Changes
- [ ] Source files updated
- [ ] `/minimize-files` run
- [ ] `.min-mirror/` changes reviewed
- [ ] `deploy-dist.yml` updated (if new directories)
