# /complete-prd

Verify all epics and stories derived from a PRD are complete, then close the PRD tracker issue.

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<prd-issue-number>` | PRD tracker issue number (e.g., `151` or `#151`) |

---

## Usage

```bash
/complete-prd 151
/complete-prd #151
```

---

## Prerequisites

- PRD tracker issue exists with `prd` label
- PRD was created via `/create-backlog` (has linked epics)

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate PRD Issue

Parse issue number (accept `151` or `#151`):
```bash
issue_num="${1#\#}"
```

Verify PRD label:
```bash
gh issue view $issue_num --json labels -q '.labels[].name' | grep -q "prd"
```

**If not a PRD issue:**
```
Error: Issue #$issue_num does not have the 'prd' label.
This command requires a PRD tracker issue.
```

### Step 2: Find Linked Epics

Find all epics that reference this PRD tracker:

```bash
# Search for epics containing "PRD Tracker: #{issue_num}"
gh issue list --label "epic" --state all --json number,title,body,state
```

Filter to epics whose body contains `**PRD Tracker:** #{issue_num}`.

**If no epics found:**
```
Warning: No epics found linked to PRD #{issue_num}.
Check that epics have "PRD Tracker: #{issue_num}" in their body.
```

### Step 3: Check Epic Completion

For each linked epic:

```bash
gh issue view #{epic} --json state -q '.state'
```

**Collect:**
- Total epics count
- Closed epics count
- Open epics list

### Step 4: Check Story Completion

For each linked epic, get sub-issues (stories):

```bash
gh pmu sub list #{epic} --json
```

**Collect:**
- Total stories count
- Closed stories count
- Open stories list

### Step 5: Report Status

**If all complete:**

```
✅ PRD #{issue_num} Verification Complete

## Summary

Epics: {closed_epics}/{total_epics} complete
Stories: {closed_stories}/{total_stories} complete

All work items are complete. Closing PRD tracker.
```

Then close:
```bash
gh pmu move $issue_num --status done
gh issue comment $issue_num --body "## PRD Complete ✅

All epics and stories have been completed.

**Final Summary:**
- Epics: {closed_epics}
- Stories: {closed_stories}

PRD closed by \`/complete-prd\` on {date}."
```

**If incomplete:**

```
⚠️ PRD #{issue_num} Not Ready for Closure

## Incomplete Work

### Open Epics ({open_epic_count})
- #{epic1}: {title}
- #{epic2}: {title}

### Open Stories ({open_story_count})
- #{story1}: {title} (Epic: #{epic})
- #{story2}: {title} (Epic: #{epic})

## Summary

Epics: {closed_epics}/{total_epics} complete
Stories: {closed_stories}/{total_stories} complete

Complete the above items before running /complete-prd again.
```

**Do NOT close** if any items are incomplete.

### Step 6: Move Proposal to Implemented (After Closure)

**Only runs when Step 5 successfully closes the PRD tracker.**

Locate and move the original proposal file to `Proposal/Implemented/`.

**Step 6a: Find the source proposal**

Extract the proposal issue reference from the PRD tracker issue body:

```
Pattern: **Source Proposal:** #NNN
```

If found, read the proposal issue to get the file path:

```bash
gh issue view $proposal_issue --json body --jq '.body'
```

Extract the proposal file path from:

```
Pattern: **File:** Proposal/[Name].md
```

**Step 6b: Move proposal file**

If the proposal file exists at the extracted path:

```bash
# Ensure Proposal/Implemented/ exists
mkdir -p Proposal/Implemented

# Check if file is tracked by git
git ls-files --error-unmatch Proposal/{Name}.md 2>/dev/null

# If untracked: git add first so git mv can work
git add Proposal/{Name}.md

# Move to Implemented
git mv Proposal/{Name}.md Proposal/Implemented/{Name}.md
```

**Step 6c: Handle edge cases**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Proposal already in `Proposal/Implemented/` | Skip — already moved (by `/create-prd` Phase 7). Non-blocking. |
| Proposal file not found at path | Warn: `"Proposal file not found: {path}. Skipping proposal move."` Continue — non-blocking. |
| No `**Source Proposal:**` in PRD tracker body | Warn: `"No source proposal reference found in PRD tracker."` Continue — non-blocking. |
| Proposal issue not found or closed | Use the issue body from the closed proposal issue (works with `gh issue view` for closed issues). |
| `git mv` fails | Warn and continue — PRD completion is not blocked by proposal move failure. |

**Step 6d: Include in commit**

If the proposal was moved, stage and commit:

```bash
git add Proposal/Implemented/{Name}.md
git commit -m "Refs #$issue_num — move proposal to Implemented after PRD completion"
```

If no proposal was moved (already in Implemented or not found), skip the commit.

## Verification Logic

```
PRD Complete = (ALL epics CLOSED) AND (ALL stories CLOSED)
```

| Epics | Stories | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| All closed | All closed | ✅ Close PRD |
| Any open | Any state | ❌ Report incomplete |
| All closed | Any open | ❌ Report incomplete |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| PRD issue not found | "Issue #N not found. Check the issue number?" |
| Issue missing prd label | "Issue #N does not have 'prd' label." |
| No linked epics found | Warning + suggest manual verification |
| PRD already closed | "PRD #{N} is already closed." |
