# /merge-branch

Merge the current branch to main with gated validation checks. Use this command when merging without creating a version tag (e.g., feature branches, refactoring work). For versioned releases with tagging, use `/prepare-release` instead.

## Available Extension Points

| Point | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `pre-gate` | Before gates | Setup, environment preparation |
| `gates` | Gate checks | **Custom validation gates** |
| `post-gate` | After gates pass | Pre-merge actions |
| `post-pr-create` | After PR creation | CI wait, PR validation |
| `post-merge` | After PR merged | Post-merge actions |
| `post-close` | After cleanup | Notifications, announcements |

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--skip-gates` | Emergency bypass - skip all gates (use with caution) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview actions without executing |

---

## Execution Instructions

**REQUIRED:** Before executing this command:

1. **Generate Todo List:** Parse the phases and extension points in this spec, then use `TodoWrite` to create todos
2. **Include Extensions:** For each non-empty `USER-EXTENSION` block, add a todo item
3. **Track Progress:** Mark todos `in_progress` → `completed` as you work
4. **Post-Compaction:** If resuming after context compaction, re-read this spec and regenerate todos

**Todo Generation Rules:**
- One todo per numbered phase/step
- One todo per active extension point (non-empty `USER-EXTENSION` blocks)
- Skip commented-out extensions
- Use the phase/step name as the todo content

---

## Pre-Checks

### Verify on Feature Branch

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

Must NOT be on `main`. Typical branches: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `idpf/*`, `patch/*`, `release/*`.

### Check for Tracker Issue

```bash
gh pmu branch current --json tracker
```

If a tracker issue exists, it will be closed at the end.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-gate -->
<!-- Setup: prepare environment before gate checks -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-gate -->

## Phase 1: Gate Checks

**If `--skip-gates` is passed, skip to Phase 2.**

### Default Gates (Framework-Provided)

These gates always run (cannot be disabled):

#### Gate 1.1: No Uncommitted Changes

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**FAIL if output is not empty.** All changes must be committed.

#### Gate 1.2: Tests Pass

```bash
npm test 2>/dev/null || echo "No test script configured"
```

**FAIL if tests fail.** Skip if no test script.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: gates -->
<!-- Custom gates: add project-specific validation here -->
<!-- Example: coverage threshold, lint checks, security scans -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: gates -->

### Gate Summary

Report gate results:
- ✅ Gate passed
- ❌ Gate failed (with details)

**If any gate fails, STOP and report.**

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-gate -->
<!-- Post-gate: actions after all gates pass -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-gate -->

---

## Phase 2: Create and Merge PR

### Step 2.1: Push Branch

```bash
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Step 2.2: Create PR

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head $(git branch --show-current) \
  --title "Merge: $(git branch --show-current)"
```

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-pr-create -->
<!-- BUILT-IN: ci-wait (disabled by default)
### Wait for CI

```bash
node .claude/scripts/framework/wait-for-ci.js
```

**If CI fails, STOP and report.**
-->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-pr-create -->

### Step 2.3: Wait for PR Approval

**ASK USER:** Review and approve the PR.

```bash
gh pr view --json reviewDecision
```

#### Gate 2.4: PR Approved

**FAIL if PR is not approved** (unless `--skip-gates`).

### Step 2.5: Merge PR

```bash
gh pr merge --merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-merge -->
<!-- Post-merge: actions after PR is merged -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-merge -->

---

## Phase 3: Cleanup

### Step 3.1: Close Tracker Issue (if exists)

```bash
gh issue close [TRACKER_NUMBER] --comment "Branch merged to main"
```

### Step 3.2: Close Branch in Project (if exists)

```bash
gh pmu branch close 2>/dev/null || echo "No branch to close"
```

### Step 3.3: Delete Branch

```bash
# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete $BRANCH

# Delete local branch
git branch -d $BRANCH
```

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-close -->
<!-- Post-close: notifications, announcements -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-close -->

---

## Completion

Branch merge complete:
- ✅ All gates passed
- ✅ PR created and merged
- ✅ Tracker issue closed (if applicable)
- ✅ Branch deleted

---

## Comparison: /merge-branch vs /prepare-release

| Feature | /merge-branch | /prepare-release |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Version bump | No | Yes |
| CHANGELOG update | No | Yes |
| Git tag | No | Yes |
| GitHub Release | No | Yes |
| Gates | Yes | Yes (via validation) |
| PR to main | Yes | Yes |
| Close tracker | Yes | Yes |
| Delete branch | Yes | Yes |

**Use `/merge-branch` for:** Feature branches, fix branches, non-versioned work.
**Use `/prepare-release` for:** Versioned releases with CHANGELOG and tags.

---

**End of Merge Branch**
