<!-- EXTENSIBLE -->
# /destroy-branch
Safely abandon and delete a branch. Destructive operation requiring explicit confirmation.
**Extension Points:** See `.claude/metadata/extension-points.json` or run `/extensions list --command destroy-branch`
---
## Arguments
| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[branch-name]` | Branch to destroy (optional, defaults to current) |
| `--force` | Skip confirmation (dangerous) |
---
## Pre-Checks
### Identify Target Branch
```bash
BRANCH=${1:-$(git branch --show-current)}
```
### Cannot Destroy Main
```bash
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$BRANCH" = "master" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Cannot destroy main/master branch"
  exit 1
fi
```
### Check Branch Exists
```bash
git rev-parse --verify "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null
```
**FAIL if branch does not exist.**

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: pre-destroy -->
<!-- Pre-destruction validation: check for unmerged commits, etc. -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: pre-destroy -->

## Phase 1: Confirmation
**DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION** — will permanently delete:
- Local branch: `$BRANCH`
- Remote branch: `origin/$BRANCH`
- Release artifacts: `Releases/[prefix]/[identifier]/`
- Tracker issue (closed as "not planned")
### Step 1.1: Show What Will Be Destroyed
```bash
git log main..$BRANCH --oneline 2>/dev/null || echo "No unmerged commits"
ls -la Releases/*/$BRANCH/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No release artifacts found"
```
### Step 1.2: Require Explicit Confirmation
**If `--force` is NOT passed:**
**ASK USER:** Type the full branch name to confirm destruction.
The user must type exactly: `$BRANCH`
**If input does not match, ABORT.**

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-confirm -->
<!-- Post-confirmation: actions after user confirms but before deletion -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-confirm -->

---
## Phase 2: Close Tracker
### Step 2.1: Find Tracker Issue
```bash
gh pmu branch current --json tracker 2>/dev/null
```
### Step 2.1.5: Remove Active Label
If a tracker issue was found:
```bash
node .claude/scripts/shared/lib/active-label.js remove [TRACKER_NUMBER]
```
### Step 2.2: Close as Not Planned
If a tracker issue exists:
```bash
gh issue close [TRACKER_NUMBER] \
  --reason "not planned" \
  --comment "Branch destroyed via /destroy-branch. Work abandoned."
```
### Step 2.3: Close Branch in Project
```bash
gh pmu branch close 2>/dev/null || echo "No branch to close"
```
---
## Phase 3: Delete Artifacts
### Step 3.1: Identify Artifact Directory
Parse branch name to find artifacts:
- `release/vX.Y.Z` -> `Releases/release/vX.Y.Z/`
- `patch/vX.Y.Z` -> `Releases/patch/vX.Y.Z/`
- `feature/name` -> `Releases/feature/name/` (if exists)
### Step 3.2: Delete Artifact Directory
```bash
ARTIFACT_DIR="Releases/${BRANCH_PREFIX}/${BRANCH_ID}"
if [ -d "$ARTIFACT_DIR" ]; then
  rm -rf "$ARTIFACT_DIR"
  git add -A
  git commit -m "chore: remove artifacts for destroyed branch $BRANCH"
fi
```
---
## Phase 4: Delete Branch
### Step 4.1: Switch to Main (if on target branch)
```bash
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "$BRANCH" ]; then
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
fi
```
### Step 4.2: Delete Remote Branch
```bash
git push origin --delete "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || echo "Remote branch not found"
```
### Step 4.3: Delete Local Branch
```bash
git branch -D "$BRANCH"
```
Using `-D` (force delete) since user confirmed abandoning unmerged work.

<!-- USER-EXTENSION-START: post-destroy -->
<!-- Post-destruction: notifications, audit logging -->
<!-- USER-EXTENSION-END: post-destroy -->

---
## Completion
Branch destroyed:
- User confirmed destruction
- Tracker issue closed (not planned)
- Artifacts deleted
- Remote branch deleted
- Local branch deleted
**This action cannot be undone.** If commits were not pushed elsewhere, they are lost.
---
## Recovery
1. **If pushed to remote before deletion:** Check if any team member has the branch
2. **If only local:** Use `git reflog` within ~30 days to find the commit
3. **Artifacts:** Check backups or git history for artifact files
---
**End of Destroy Branch**
