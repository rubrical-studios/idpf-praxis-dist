---

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-29

- **Installer Single-Specialist Support** (#603-#607) - Updated installer for single-specialist model:
  - Radio-button UI (single-select) replaces checkbox UI (multi-select)
  - Schema migration: `domainSpecialists[]` + `primarySpecialist` → `domainSpecialist`
  - Orphaned command cleanup (`switch-role.md`, `add-role.md`)
- **Branch Naming Enforcement** (#586) - `/open-release` now enforces `[prefix]/[name]` format:
  - Exactly one `/` separator required
  - Both prefix and name must be non-empty

---

## [0.16.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Installer config schema mismatch** (#581) - Fresh installations now use the new v0.16.0 config schema (`frameworkVersion`, `extensibleCommands`, `frameworkScripts`, `userScripts`) instead of the deprecated schema. Updates and migrations also properly migrate old `installedVersion`/`components` fields to the new schema.
- **Shebang displacement in JS files** (#584) - Fixed `version-header-fix.js` inserting version comment before shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`). Shebang must be first line for Unix script execution.

---

## [0.16.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Extensible Commands Installer** (#559) - Complete system for preserving user extensions during framework upgrades:

  - `install/lib/checksums.js` - SHA256 checksum computation for modification detection (NFR-002)
  - `install/lib/config.js` - Config management, manifest parsing, project type detection, schema migration (REQ-011, REQ-013-015)

---

## [0.15.4] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed
- **Release artifact orphaning** (#549) - Moved release artifact generation (release-notes.md, changelog.md) from `/close-release` to `/prepare-release` Phase 2l. Artifacts are now committed with the release PR instead of being orphaned when the release branch is deleted
- **Temp file gitignore pattern** (#550) - Added `.tmp-*` pattern to `.gitignore`. The existing `*.tmp` pattern only matched files ending in `.tmp`, not workflow temp files starting with `.tmp-`

---

- **`/add-role` token optimization** (#548) - Reduced command file from ~140 to ~60 lines (57% reduction) by using directory discovery instead of embedded specialist lists. Now supports direct argument (e.g., `/add-role Security-Engineer`)
- **Installer branch check** (#546) - Installation now checks if target project is on `main`/`master` branch. Cancels with warning on feature branches unless `--force` flag is used

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Windows guidance removed** - Eliminated redundancy between CLAUDE.md and GitHub-Workflow.md Shell Limitations sections

---

## [0.15.2] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
