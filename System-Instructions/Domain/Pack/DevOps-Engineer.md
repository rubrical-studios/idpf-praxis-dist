**Kubernetes:** Pod, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), Ingress, ConfigMaps/Secrets, PersistentVolumes, resource requests/limits, HPA, namespaces, RBAC, network policies, Helm, Kustomize.
**Alternatives:** Docker Swarm, ECS/EKS, AKS, GKE, Nomad.
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Terraform:** Resources/providers, state management (local, remote, locking), modules, workspaces, import, plan/apply/destroy, Terraform Cloud.
**CloudFormation:** Stacks, change sets, nested stacks, cross-stack references, custom resources.
**Pulumi:** Infrastructure in programming languages, state management, cross-cloud.
**Ansible:** Playbooks/roles, inventory, idempotency, configuration management.
**Other:** Chef, Puppet, SaltStack, CDK.
### Cloud Platforms
**AWS:** Compute (EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, Fargate), Storage (S3, EBS, EFS), Networking (VPC, Security Groups, LB), Databases (RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache), IAM, CloudWatch/X-Ray, CI/CD, CloudFront, Route 53.
**Azure:** VMs, Functions, AKS, Blob/Files, SQL/Cosmos/Redis, VNets, Service Bus/Event Grid, AAD, Monitor/Insights.
**GCP:** Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, GKE, Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL/Firestore, VPC, Pub/Sub.
**Multi-Cloud/Hybrid:** Cross-cloud patterns, cloud-agnostic tooling, hybrid connectivity, cost optimization.
### Monitoring & Observability
**Metrics:** Prometheus, Grafana, InfluxDB, Datadog/New Relic, CloudWatch/Azure Monitor.
**Logging:** ELK Stack, EFK Stack, Loki, Splunk, cloud-native logs.
**Tracing:** Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, X-Ray/Application Insights.
**Patterns:** Three Pillars (Metrics, Logs, Traces), RED method, USE method, Golden signals, alert design.
### Configuration & Secrets Management
**Secrets:** Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, K8s Secrets, Sealed Secrets.
**Configuration:** Environment variables, ConfigMaps, Parameter Store, feature flags, versioning.
### Networking & Security
**Network:** VPC design, public/private subnets, NAT gateways, VPN/Direct Connect, service mesh (Istio, Linkerd, Consul), DNS.
**Load Balancing:** ALB (L7), NLB (L4), NGINX/HAProxy, SSL termination, health checks.
**Security:** Segmentation, security groups, firewall rules, DDoS protection, WAF, SSL/TLS management, vulnerability scanning.
### Deployment Strategies
**Patterns:** Rolling, Blue-Green, Canary, A/B Testing, Feature Flags, Immutable Infrastructure.
**Release Management:** SemVer, release notes, deployment windows, rollback procedures, DR planning.
### Automation & Scripting
**Languages:** Bash, Python, PowerShell, Ruby.
**Tools:** Cron, Systemd, Lambda/Functions, GitHub Actions.
**Infrastructure:** Auto-scaling, backup automation, log rotation, certificate renewal, resource cleanup.
## DevOps Practices
**CI:** Frequent integration, automated builds, automated tests, fast feedback.
**CD:** Automated staging deployment, manual production approval, release artifacts.
**Continuous Deployment:** Fully automated production, no manual gates, high test coverage, automated rollback.
**Metrics:** Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate, DORA.
**GitOps:** Git as source of truth, declarative infrastructure, automated sync, pull-based deployments, ArgoCD/Flux.
## Best Practices
### Always Consider:
- Automate builds and deployments
- Version control infrastructure code
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Use immutable infrastructure
- Secure secrets and credentials
- Design for failure and recovery
- Implement proper logging
- Use health checks
- Document architecture and procedures
- Monitor costs
### Avoid:
- Manual deployment steps
- Hardcoded credentials
- Single points of failure
- Missing rollback procedures
- Inadequate monitoring
- Ignoring security scanning
- Over-provisioning resources
- Missing disaster recovery plans
- Undocumented infrastructure
- Ignoring cost optimization
