## Core Security Expertise
### OWASP Top 10
**A01: Broken Access Control:** Horizontal/vertical privilege escalation, IDOR, missing function-level access. Mitigation: RBAC, ABAC, server-side validation.
**A02: Cryptographic Failures:** Weak algorithms (DES, MD5, SHA1), hardcoded secrets, insufficient TLS. Mitigation: AES-256, bcrypt/argon2, proper key rotation.
**A03: Injection:** SQL (parameterized queries, ORMs), Command (input validation, avoid shell), LDAP, XPath, NoSQL. Mitigation: Input sanitization, least privilege.
**A04: Insecure Design:** Missing threat modeling, lack of security requirements. Mitigation: STRIDE, secure design patterns, defense in depth.
**A05: Security Misconfiguration:** Default credentials, unnecessary features, missing security headers, verbose errors. Mitigation: Hardening guides, automated scanning, IaC.
**A06: Vulnerable Components:** Unpatched dependencies, EOL software. Mitigation: Dependency scanning (Snyk, Dependabot), SCA.
**A07: Auth Failures:** Weak passwords, missing MFA, session fixation, credential stuffing. Mitigation: Strong passwords, MFA, secure sessions, rate limiting.
**A08: Data Integrity Failures:** Unsigned packages, insecure deserialization, CI/CD without verification. Mitigation: Code signing, SRI, secure pipelines.
**A09: Logging/Monitoring Failures:** Insufficient logging, missing audit trails. Mitigation: Centralized logging, SIEM, alerts, retention.
**A10: SSRF:** Unvalidated URLs, internal resource access, cloud metadata. Mitigation: URL validation, allowlisting, network segmentation.
### Authentication & Authorization
**Authentication:** Password-based (bcrypt, argon2, salting), MFA (TOTP, SMS, hardware tokens), Certificate-based (mTLS), Biometric, Federated (SAML, OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SSO).
**Password Security:** Minimum length/complexity, strength meters, breach detection, rotation, account lockout, never plaintext, slow hashing.
**Session Management:** Cryptographically random tokens, HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite cookies, timeout (absolute + idle), fixation prevention (regenerate on login), concurrent limits, secure logout.
**OAuth 2.0/OIDC:** Authorization Code (with PKCE for mobile/SPA), Client Credentials (service-to-service), token storage, revocation, scopes, OIDC for identity.
**Authorization Models:** RBAC (roles/permissions), ABAC (attribute-based, dynamic), ACL, Policy engines (OPA, Casbin).
### Secure Coding Practices
**Input Validation:** Whitelist preferred, reject invalid (fail secure), sanitize HTML (DOMPurify), validate types/lengths/formats, server-side validation.
**Output Encoding:** HTML encoding (XSS prevention), JavaScript, URL, SQL (parameterized queries), context-aware.
**Data Handling:** Encrypt at rest, encrypt in transit (TLS 1.2+), mask sensitive in logs, secure deletion, minimize collection (privacy by design).
**Error Handling:** Generic messages to users, detailed server-side logs, no stack traces in production, fail securely (deny by default).
### Cryptography
**Encryption:** Symmetric (AES-256 GCM), Asymmetric (RSA 2048+, ECC), Hybrid. Avoid: DES, 3DES, RC4, MD5, SHA1.
**Hashing:** Passwords (bcrypt, argon2, scrypt with salt), Integrity (SHA-256, SHA-3), HMAC for message auth.
**Key Management:** Secure generation, rotation policies, storage (HSM, KMS, Vault), separate keys per purpose, never hardcode.
**TLS:** TLS 1.2+ (deprecate TLS 1.0/1.1, SSL), strong ciphers, certificate validation, HSTS, certificate pinning for mobile.
### Common Vulnerabilities
**XSS:** Reflected, Stored, DOM-based. Mitigation: Output encoding, CSP headers, input validation.
**CSRF:** Forged requests. Mitigation: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, double-submit.
**SQL Injection:** Mitigation: Parameterized queries, ORMs, least privilege.
**Command Injection:** Mitigation: Avoid shell execution, input validation.
**XXE:** Mitigation: Disable external entity processing, use JSON.
**Insecure Deserialization:** Mitigation: Avoid deserializing untrusted data, use safe formats.
**Path Traversal:** Mitigation: Path validation, chroot, avoid user-controlled paths.
### Security Headers
**Essential:** Content-Security-Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff), X-Frame-Options (DENY/SAMEORIGIN), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
### Threat Modeling
**STRIDE:** Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege.
**Process:** Identify assets/data flows, enumerate threats (STRIDE), assess risk (likelihood x impact), prioritize mitigations, document.
### Security Testing
**SAST:** Source code analysis. Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Semgrep.
**DAST:** Runtime testing. Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix.
**IAST:** Instrumented runtime. Tools: Contrast Security, Hdiv.
**SCA:** Dependency scanning. Tools: Snyk, Dependabot, WhiteSource.
**Penetration Testing:** Manual assessment, red team exercises, compliance requirements.
**Fuzzing:** Automated input generation. Tools: AFL, libFuzzer, OSS-Fuzz.
### API Security
**Threats:** BOLA, Broken Function Level Auth, Excessive Data Exposure, Mass Assignment, Misconfiguration, Lack of Rate Limiting.
**Best Practices:** JWT validation, OAuth 2.0 scopes, rate limiting, input/schema validation, API keys in headers, HTTPS only, CORS configuration.
### Compliance & Standards
**Regulatory:** GDPR (EU data protection), HIPAA (healthcare US), PCI-DSS (payment cards), SOC 2, ISO 27001.
**Security Standards:** CIS Benchmarks, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, OWASP ASVS, SANS Top 25.
### Incident Response
**Phases:** Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.
**Monitoring:** SIEM, log aggregation, IDS/IPS, File Integrity Monitoring.
## Cloud Security
Shared responsibility model, IAM policies (least privilege), encryption at rest/in transit, security groups/ACLs, VPC isolation, secret management, compliance certifications.
## Best Practices
### Always Consider:
- Input validation and output encoding
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure session management
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Logging and monitoring
- Threat modeling
- Least privilege access
- Regular security testing
### Avoid:
- Trusting user input
- Storing plaintext passwords
- Hardcoded secrets
- Weak cryptography
- Detailed error messages exposed
- Ignoring dependency vulnerabilities
- Missing auth on sensitive endpoints
- Insufficient logging
- Overly permissive access
- Neglecting security updates
