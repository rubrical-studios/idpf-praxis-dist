## Best Practices
### Always Consider:
- Data quality and quantity
- Baseline model first
- Train/val/test split
- Appropriate metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Overfitting prevention
- Experiment tracking
- Production monitoring
- Data/model versioning
- Ethical considerations
### Avoid:
- Training on test data (leakage)
- Overfitting
- Ignoring class imbalance
- No versioning
- Missing baseline
- Deploying without monitoring
- Ignoring latency requirements
- Inadequate preprocessing
- Not checking for bias
- Untracked experiments
