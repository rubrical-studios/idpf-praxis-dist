## Unreal Engine (C++/Blueprints)
### Architecture
Actor/Component model, GameMode/GameState/PlayerController hierarchy, reflection (UCLASS, UPROPERTY, UFUNCTION), Blueprints, Subsystems
### C++ Patterns
Smart pointers (TSharedPtr, TWeakPtr), Unreal containers (TArray, TMap), delegates, interfaces, GAS, Enhanced Input
### Physics
Chaos Physics, Physics Assets, constraints, collision channels
### Rendering
Nanite, Lumen, Virtual Shadow Maps, Material Editor, Niagara particles, post-process
### UI
UMG, Widget Blueprints, Common UI, Slate
### Multiplayer
Replication, RPCs, authority, network relevancy, dedicated/listen servers, prediction
## Godot Development (GDScript/C#)
### Architecture
Node/Scene tree, GDScript, C# support, signals, resources, autoloads
### Patterns
Export variables, onready variables, groups, custom resources, tool scripts
### Physics
Physics2D/Physics3D servers, RigidBody, KinematicBody, Area nodes, Jolt integration
### Rendering
Vulkan/OpenGL, CanvasItem, Materials, visual shaders, environment
### Multiplayer
High-level API, RPC, multiplayer synchronizer, ENet/WebSocket
## Game Architecture Patterns
### Entity Component System (ECS)
Entities as IDs, components as data, systems process entities - Unity DOTS, Unreal Mass Entity
**When:** Large entity counts, performance-critical simulations
### Game Loop
Fixed timestep (physics), variable timestep (rendering), interpolation, frame pacing
### State Machines
FSM (states with enter/exit/update), HSM (nested states), Behavior Trees (AI decision making)
### Event Systems
Observer pattern, message queues, decoupled communication
### Object Pooling
Pre-allocate objects, active/inactive lists, reset on recycle, avoid GC
## Performance Optimization
### CPU
Profile first, algorithmic improvements, cache-friendly data, avoid allocations in hot paths, multithreading (job systems)
### GPU
Batch draw calls, GPU instancing, texture atlases, shader optimization, LOD
### Memory
Addressables/asset bundles, object pooling, struct vs class, avoid boxing
### Profiling Tools
**Unity:** Profiler, Frame Debugger, Memory Profiler
**Unreal:** Unreal Insights, Stat commands, GPU Visualizer
**General:** RenderDoc, PIX, Instruments
## Asset Pipeline
### 3D Assets
FBX, glTF, OBJ, USD - scale/units, coordinate systems, LOD generation
### 2D Assets
PNG, sprite sheets, atlases, Spine/DragonBones animation
### Audio
WAV (source), OGG (compressed), FMOD/Wwise middleware, spatial audio
### Build Pipeline
Platform-specific settings, compression, CI/CD, Git LFS
## Platform Considerations
**PC:** Variable hardware, quality options, input variety, Steam/Epic/GOG
**Console:** Fixed hardware, certification, controller-first
**Mobile:** Touch input, battery/thermal, memory limits, app stores
**Web:** Browser compatibility, download size, WebGL limitations
## Best Practices
### Always Consider:
- Frame rate and performance budgets
- Memory constraints (especially mobile)
- Input responsiveness
- Platform-specific requirements
- Asset optimization and streaming
- Object pooling
- Profiling before/after optimization
- Data-driven design
### Avoid:
- Premature optimization without profiling
- Allocations in Update loops
- Tight coupling between systems
- Ignoring platform constraints
- Hardcoded values (use data assets)
- Synchronous loading during gameplay
- Unbounded collections
- Ignoring target frame rate
