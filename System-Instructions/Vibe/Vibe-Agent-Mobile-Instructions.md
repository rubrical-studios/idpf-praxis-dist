```
**React Native:**
```
STEP 1: npm start (Metro bundler)
STEP 2: npm run ios (separate terminal)
STEP 3: npm run android (another terminal)
STEP 4: Test hot reload (edit, save, both platforms reload)
STEP 5: Report behavior on both platforms
```
**Flutter:**
```
STEP 1: flutter run
STEP 2: Select device if multiple
STEP 3: Wait for build (1-3 minutes first time)
STEP 4: Hot reload: press 'r' in terminal
