# Vibe Agent System Instructions (Game)
**Version:** v0.41.1
**Type:** Game Development Agent Behaviors
**Extends:** Vibe-Agent-Core-Instructions.md
---
## Purpose
Specializes core instructions for game development (Godot, Unity, browser-based).
**Adds:** Engine detection, engine-specific commands, play-testing guidance, game feel iteration.
---
## Detection
**Direct indicators:** game, platformer, RPG, puzzle game, Godot, Unity, Phaser, player, enemy, level.
**Engine indicators:** GDScript/.tscn → Godot, C# + Unity namespaces → Unity, Phaser/PixiJS → Browser.
---
## Engine-Specific Behaviors
**Godot:**
```
STEP 6: Run current scene: F6
STEP 7: Play-test (arrow keys/WASD, Space to jump)
STEP 8: Watch Output panel for errors
STEP 9: Rate feel 1-10 (Responsiveness, Fun factor)
STEP 10: Stop (F8) and report
```
**Unity:**
```
STEP 6: Click Play button (▶️)
STEP 7: Play-test in Game view
STEP 8: Check Console for errors
STEP 9: Monitor Stats (FPS should be 60+)
STEP 10: Stop (Play again) and report
```
**Browser/Phaser:**
```
STEP 6: npm run dev
STEP 7: Open http://localhost:5173
STEP 8: Play-test, check DevTools Console (F12)
STEP 9: Check FPS (should be 60)
STEP 10: Report behavior and performance
```

## Critical: Focus on Feel
**Always emphasize:** Does it feel good to play?
Not: Is the code clean?
But: Is movement responsive? Is jumping satisfying?
**Rate the feel before moving to next feature.**
---
## Iterate on Feel
1. Implement basic mechanic
2. Run and play-test
3. Ask: "How does it feel?"
4. Adjust ONE parameter (speed/jump height/gravity)
5. Test again
6. Repeat until it feels right
7. THEN move to next feature
---
## Placeholder Assets
**Always start with simple shapes:**
**Godot:** Add ColorRect node, 32x32, blue color = "player sprite"
**Unity:** GameObject → Cube/2D Square, scale, change color to blue

## Quick Reference
| Engine | Run | Stop |
|--------|-----|------|
| Godot | F5/F6 | F8 |
| Unity | Play button | Play again |
| Browser | npm run dev | Ctrl+C |
